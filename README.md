Externs for Firebase v6 https://rnfirebase.io/

React Native Firebase v6 has new deployment scheme comparing to previous versions and so requires new set of externs.

Note that each Firebase module needs to be installed manually, please refer to https://rnfirebase.io/ for more info.

Current API is covered by dts2hx so errors or inconsistencies possible. PRs are welcome.
